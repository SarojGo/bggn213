## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


## K-means clustering

Let's try the `kmeans()` function in R to cluster some made-up example data

rnorm gives you a set of numbers (first argument) whose average is equal to a specific number (second argument)

cbind combines objects by rows or columns based on given names in argument, can define names as stored vectors

```{r}
tmp <- c(rnorm(30,-3), rnorm(30,3))
x <- cbind(x=tmp, y=rev(tmp))
plot(x)
```

Can use kmeans to cluster data based on where you assign centers(k value) and size of clusters (nstart)


```{r}
km <- kmeans(x, centers = 2, nstart = 20)

km
```

```{r}
km$size

```

let's check how many 2s and 1s are in the cluster vector of km with the `table()` function

```{r}
table(km$cluster)
```

Plot x colored by the kmeans cluster assignment and add cluster centers as blue points

```{r}
plot(x, col= km$cluster)
points(km$centers, col="blue", pch=15, cex=3)
```
Can pick specific colors for each set by using c(rep("red", 30), rep("blue", 30))



For hierarchical clusterin , can use hclust function. the `hclust()` function is the main Hierarchical clustering method in R and it **must** be passed a **distance matrix** as input, not your raw data

Can add line to plot using abline

```{r}
hc <- hclust(dist(x))

plot(hc)
abline(h=6, col = "red")
```
To only read out specific part of plot, can use cutree(hc, h= where you want to cut off) or use k= number of clusters you want to cut tree off at


```{r}
plot(hc)
abline(h=6, col = "red", lty=2)
cutree(hc, k=4)

```



```{r}
x <- rbind(
 matrix(rnorm(100, mean=0, sd=0.3), ncol = 2), # c1
 matrix(rnorm(100, mean=1, sd=0.3), ncol = 2), # c2
 matrix(c(rnorm(50, mean=1, sd=0.3), # c3
 rnorm(50, mean=0, sd=0.3)), ncol = 2))
colnames(x) <- c("x", "y")

plot(x)
# Step 3. Generate colors for known clusters
# (just so we can compare to hclust results)
col <- as.factor( rep(c("c1","c2","c3"), each=50) )
plot(x, col=col)
```

```{r}
hc <- hclust(dist(x))

plot(hc)
grps3 <- cutree(hc, k=3)
plot(x, col= grps3 + 1)

```


# Principal Component Analysis (PCA

TH emain fucntion in base R for PCA is called `prcomp()` Here we awill use PCA to examine the funny food people eat in the UK and N. Ireland.

```{r}
x <- read.csv("UK_foods.csv", row.names = 1)
x
```

Make some conventional plots

```{r}
barplot(as.matrix(x), beside=T, col = rainbow(nrow(x)))
```

```{r}
pairs(x, col= rainbow(10), pch=16)
```

use PCA to get better analysis of data

```{r}
pca <- prcomp( t(x))

#need to transpose as PCA prefers each country as row names
```

```{r}
summary(pca)
```

```{r}
attributes(pca)
```

Generate PCA plot

```{r}
plot(pca$x[,1], pca$x[,2], xlab="PC1 (67.4%)", ylab="PC2 (29%)", xlim=c(-270,500))
text(pca$x[,1], pca$x[,2], colnames(x),
     col= c("red", "blue", "green", "darkgreen"))
```


```{r}

```
